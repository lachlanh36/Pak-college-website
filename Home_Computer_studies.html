In 9COM, we develop a 2D computer game that is fun and also fulfills a purpose. We use the software "Construct 2", typically to make a platform game with multiple levels. It involves creating the levels, setting up graphics, setting game object behaviours and programming the actions that occur in the game. The programming is straightforward, but students have the opportunity to create very advanced games as well. Throughout the development of the game studentrs work through a technology process that ensdures the game they make is fit for purpose and meets the brief.
<br> <br>
In 10COM students start by doing more advanced game programming. They learn more complex programming techniques and explore more sophisticated game genres and styles. As a project, students are required to make a game in a context that is meaningful and authentic. For instance, they may be asked to make a game that can be used for language acquisition, and hence could be used in the classroom. As well as game development, students learn some basic scripting in javascript and have an introduction to web development and image manipulation. As a final extension, students have the opportunity to learn 3D game design using professional game development tools.
